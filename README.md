### Notes/Assumptions
- gender neutral
- file formatting
    - what does this mean: The complete data set is included in your project repository (you can also browse it here), but your program should support easily changing the location of the source data (e.g., getting it from your local file system or from the web, getting the full data set or a smaller test subset or a single file). You should comment both in your code and in your README how to change the data source so that we know how to run your program on our own subsets of the data that may have different expected values.
    - file name is formatted a certain way
    - file always has girls and then boys
    - genders will be put in uppercase as M or F
