# Data Plan
## NAME

This is the link to the [assignment](http://www.cs.duke.edu/courses/compsci307/current/assign/01_data/):


### What is the answer to the two questions below for the data file yob1900.txt (pick a letter that makes it easy too answer)? 
1. The top ranked female name is Mary, and the top ranked male name is John.
2. In 1900 for males, 1 name starts with the letter Z (Zeno), and 5 total babies have names starting with the letter Z.

### Describe the algorithm you would use to answer each one.
1. Go through the s

### Likely you may not even need a data structure to answer the questions below, but what about some of the questions in Part 2?

### What are some ways you could test your code to make sure it is giving the correct answer (think beyond just choosing "lucky" parameter values)?

### What kinds of things make the second question harder to test?

### What kind of errors might you expect to encounter based on the questions or in the dataset?

### How would you detect those errors and what would a reasonable "answer" be in such cases?

### How would your algorithm and testing need to change (if at all) to handle multiple files (i.e., a range of years)?
